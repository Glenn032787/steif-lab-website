  description: Isolatrix is a novel well-based robotics approach that combines very fast cell dispensing with customizable well chemistry. We hypothesize that the Isolatrix will allow the production of high-quality total full-length scRNAseq libraries at scale. Isolatrix has image capability which could be used for neural network classification of cell types.
