The Steif lab is a group of researchers working to develop and utilize computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional single cell genomics data. With these tools, we aim to uncover insights in cancer development. Our group is based at the Genome Science Center in the BC Cancer Research Institute.

## Highlights
