Dr. Adi Steif's research is focused on developing and applying computational methods for high-throughput genomics, with a particular interest in characterizing disease mechanisms and evolution in the context of cancer. New measurement technologies are enabling large-scale genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of tissues at the single cell level. Working alongside experimental collaborators, the Steif Lab uses statistical machine learning approaches to derive biological insights from these high-dimensional datasets in the presence of noise and measurement bias.
